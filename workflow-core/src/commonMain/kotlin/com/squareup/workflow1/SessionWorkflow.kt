import kotlinx.coroutines.CoroutineScope

/**
 * An extension of [StatefulWorkflow] that gives [initialState] a [CoroutineScope]
 * that corresponds with the lifetime of _session_ driven by this Workflow.
 *
 * A session begins the first time a parent passes a child [Workflow] of a particular type to
 * [renderChild] with a particular [key] parameter. It ends when the parent executes [render]
 * without making a matching [renderChild] call. The [CoroutineScope] that is passed to
 * [initialState] is created when a session starts (when [renderChild] is first called), and
 * [cancelled][kotlinx.coroutines.Job.cancel] when the session ends.
 *
 * This API extension exists on [StatefulWorkflow] as well, but it is confusing because the version
 * of [initialState] that does not have the [CoroutineScope] must also be implemented as it is
 * an abstract fun, even though it would never be used.
 * With this version, that confusion is removed and only the version of [initialState] with the
 * [CoroutineScope] must be implemented.

   *
   * This version adds the following:
   * @param workflowScope A [CoroutineScope] that has been created when this Workflow is first
   * rendered and canceled when it is no longer rendered.
   *
   * This [CoroutineScope] can be used to:
   *
   *  - set reliable startup and teardown hooks, e.g. via
   *  [Job.invokeOnCompletion][kotlinx.coroutines.Job.invokeOnCompletion]:
   *
   *        override fun initialState(
   *          props: Unit,
   *          snapshot: Snapshot?,
   *          workflowScope: CoroutineScope
   *        ): MyState {
   *          someService.start()
   *          workflowScope.coroutineContext.job.invokeOnCompletion {
   *            someService.stop()
   *          }
   *
   *          return MyState()
   *        }
   *
   *  -  own the transforms on a [StateFlow][kotlinx.coroutines.flow.StateFlow],
   *     linking them to the lifetime of a Workflow session. For example,
   *     here is how you might safely combine two `StateFlow`s:
   *
   *        data class MyState(
   *          val derivedValue: String,
   *          val derivedWorker: Worker<String>
   *        )
   *
   *        override fun initialState(
   *          props: Unit,
   *          snapshot: Snapshot?,
   *          workflowScope: CoroutineScope
   *        ): MyState {
   *          val transformedStateFlow = stateFlow1.combine(stateFlow2, {val1, val2 -> val1 - val2}).
   *            stateIn(workflowScope, SharingStarted.Eagerly, ${stateFlow1.value}-${stateFlow2.value})
   *
   *          return MyState(
   *            transformedStateFlow.value,
   *            transformedStateFlow.asWorker()
   *          )
   *        }
   *
   * **Note Carefully**: Neither [workflowScope] nor any of these transformed/computed dependencies
   * should be stored by this Workflow instance. This could be re-created, or re-used unexpectedly
   * and should not have its own state. Instead, the transformed/computed dependencies must be
   * put into the [StateT] of this Workflow in order to be properly maintained.
